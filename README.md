# Terrarium

Terrarium is an open-source artificial intelligence learning platform.

## How to use

To begin, you can git clone this repository.

### Installing Dependencies

First, you will need python3. You can download it wherever fine python3's are sold.

We store our dependencies in `requirements.txt`. Simply run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` (remember python3! If you need to, use `pip3`).

### Building an Agent

You can build your own agents whereever you would like. We have some examples of both types of agents: environment-specific and generic. You can find examples of these in this repository.
